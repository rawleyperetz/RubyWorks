My journey with Ruby.

Startserver.rb and Startclient.rb are for networking communication purposes. It has been optimized only for a single client to server communication. Adjust if you will.
Code may not be optimized. Take it easy on me, I am merely starting with Ruby. Hope you like it. Don't misuse the code :) . Tsch√ºss

todolist.rb is a command-line ruby program using command-line argument parsing for connecting to MySQL database. Code may not be optimized. Feel free to adjust. Also read first few comment lines of the todolist.rb file
